This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's content library and user engagement to uncover trends in viewing behavior, content preferences, and subscription patterns. Using publicly available datasets, including information on movies, TV shows, ratings, and user reviews, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights into how content is consumed across different genres, regions, and demographic segments.
Key Objectives:
1.	Content Analysis: Investigate the distribution of movies and TV shows by genre, release year, and country of origin. Identify trends in Netflix’s content acquisition strategy over time.
2.	User Engagement: Analyze viewing habits such as the number of hours watched, average ratings, and content consumption patterns by region and demographic (age, gender, etc.).
3.	Popularity Trends: Identify the most popular content (by genre, rating, or number of views) and explore what factors contribute to its success.
4.	Subscription Insights: Examine subscriber growth and regional differences in the availability of content to understand Netflix’s market positioning and potential for growth.
5.	Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews to gauge the public’s reception of various shows and movies.
Tools and Techniques Used:
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
•	Visualization: Leverage tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations.
•	Statistical Analysis: Use correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and data aggregation techniques to identify significant relationships within the data.
•	Predictive Modeling (Optional): Build recommendation models using machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering to predict user preferences.
Expected Outcomes:
•	A comprehensive view of Netflix’s content distribution and how it aligns with audience preferences.
•	Insights into which genres, countries, and release years contribute to the platform’s most popular content.
•	Recommendations for improving content strategies and subscriber engagement.
•	A better understanding of viewer sentiment based on ratings and reviews.
This project highlights the ability to process large datasets, apply data analytics techniques, and provide strategic recommendations based on trends and insights in the entertainment industry.
